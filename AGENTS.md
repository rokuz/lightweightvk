This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Source Control Rules

- **NEVER** commit, amend, or submit diffs unless explicitly asked to do so.

## Project Overview

LightweightVK is a bindless-only fork of IGL designed to run on Vulkan 1.3+ with optional mesh shaders and ray tracing support. It serves as a modern, minimalistic graphics API wrapper focused on rapid prototyping of Vulkan-based renderers.

## Build System and Commands

### Initial Setup
Before building, run the bootstrapping scripts to download dependencies:
```bash
python3 deploy_deps.py
python3 deploy_content.py
```
- `deploy_deps.py`: Clones/downloads third-party libraries (Vulkan headers, GLFW, GLM, ImGui, Tracy, Slang, etc.) into `third-party/deps/`. Driven by `third-party/bootstrap-deps.json`. Some libraries (Slang, screenshot tests) use Python predicates to allow CI jobs to skip them via environment variables (e.g., `LVK_WITH_SLANG=OFF`).
- `deploy_content.py`: Downloads sample assets (Bistro scene, solar system textures, glTF models, HDR skyboxes, etc.) into `third-party/content/`. Driven by `third-party/bootstrap-content.json`.

Both scripts invoke `third-party/bootstrap.py` which reads the corresponding JSON manifest and fetches git repos, archives, or individual files.

- `tools/make_nss_model.py`: shape-specializes the Arm NSS network for another render resolution (`--render 1920x1080` writes the model `DEMO_003_NeuralSuperSampling --4k` needs). `deploy_content.py` runs it for 1920x1080 when that model is missing, so the 4K scenario needs no separate step; it warns and carries on if the Vulkan SDK or a C++ compiler is not there yet. It runs TOSA shape inference over the shape-agnostic model Arm publishes and rebuilds the VGF with `tools/vgf_respecialize.cpp`, which it builds on demand (that target is excluded from the default build). Its docstring has the details; do not restate them here.
- `tools/train_dfaoit.py`: trains a neural OIT network of `DEMO_004_NeuralOIT` and writes `third-party/content/src/dfaoit/dfaoit-<hidden1>x<hidden2>.vgf`, the network as an unspecialized VGF (`--hidden1/--hidden2` pick the topology, and the sample's `--network` picks between the deployed ones). The network ships quantized to 8 bits, after a few epochs of quantization-aware fine-tuning, as the TOSA integer graph (int8 CONV2D into int32, per-channel RESCALE, a TABLE for the sigmoid) an NPU runs natively; the script evaluates that graph bit for bit and prints its validation error next to the float one's. Training data is synthetic and needs no renderer or scene file: `tools/dfaoit_scenes.py` builds scenes of spheres, boxes, quads and tori and fires tiles of orthographic rays through them; `--cache` keeps the sampled pixels for the next run. Their docstrings have the details.
- `tools/make_dfaoit_model.py`: shape-specializes one of those VGFs for a tensor shape (`--source <...>/dfaoit-16x16.vgf --render 1920x810` writes what the sample loads; the height is `kTensorHeight`, not the window height, because the sample compacts the pixels that need the network). It shares its machinery with `make_nss_model.py`. The VGF itself is written by `tools/mlp_vgf.cpp` (a standalone tool excluded from the default build, it assembles the TOSA graph module and encodes the container), which `train_dfaoit.py` builds on demand.

### Platform-Specific Build Commands

**Windows:**
```bash
cd build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 18 2026"
```

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install clang xorg-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libgles2-mesa-dev libegl1-mesa-dev libglfw3-dev libglew-dev libstdc++-12-dev extra-cmake-modules libxkbcommon-x11-dev wayland-protocols
cd build
cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles"
```

For Wayland: `cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" -DLVK_WITH_WAYLAND=ON`

**macOS:**
Requires VulkanSDK 1.4.357+
```bash
cd build
cmake .. -G "Xcode"
```

**Android:**
Requires Android Studio, ANDROID_NDK, JAVA_HOME, and adb in PATH
```bash
cd build
cmake .. -DLVK_WITH_SAMPLES_ANDROID=ON
cd android/001_HelloTriangle  # or any other sample
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

For Android devices: `python3 deploy_content_android.py` (or configure with `-DLVK_ANDROID_OBB_CONTENT=ON` and build the `LVKAndroidContent` target, which installs the same archive as the OBB of every generated demo)

### Building
```bash
cmake --build build --parallel
```

### Running and Testing
No unit test framework. Verify changes by building and running samples headless:
```bash
./build/samples/001_HelloTriangle --headless --screenshot-frame 1 --screenshot-file out.png
```

### Screenshot Tests
CI runs screenshot comparison tests (enabled by default via `LVK_DEPLOY_SCREENSHOT_TESTS`). Reference images, frame numbers, and the comparison script are in a [separate repository](https://github.com/corporateshark/lightweightvk_screenshot_tests) — see its [README](https://github.com/corporateshark/lightweightvk_screenshot_tests/blob/master/README.md) for details.

### CI (GitHub Actions)
Workflow file: `.github/workflows/c-cpp.yml`. Runs on every push and PR to any branch. Four jobs:

1. **Android (Ubuntu)** — generates Android projects with Ninja + NDK r29, assembles APKs for a subset of samples
2. **Build matrix** — Debug builds, no screenshot tests: Windows - MSVC 2026 (GLFW and SDL3), Ubuntu - Clang (GLFW, SDL3 and Wayland), Ubuntu - GCC (SDL3)
3. **macOS - Clang (Xcode)** — Debug build, Tracy disabled, no screenshot tests
4. **Ubuntu - Clang (screenshot tests)** — Debug build with `LVK_DEPLOY_SCREENSHOT_TESTS=ON`, runs samples headless at 1280×720, captures screenshots, then compares against reference images using `compare_screenshots.py` (threshold 1.0). Logs and screenshots are uploaded as artifacts (3-day retention)

All jobs cache `third-party/deps` keyed on `bootstrap-deps.json` hash; every job except Android uses Vulkan SDK 1.4.350.0.

To check CI status: `gh run list` or `gh run view <run-id>`.

### CMake Configuration Options

- `LVK_WITH_GLFW`: Enable GLFW (default: ON)
- `LVK_WITH_SDL3`: Enable SDL3 (default: OFF)
- `LVK_WITH_SAMPLES`: Enable sample demo apps (default: ON)
- `LVK_WITH_SAMPLES_ANDROID`: Generate Android projects for demo apps (default: OFF)

- `LVK_IMGUI_EXTERNAL`: Use external ImGui library (default: OFF)
- `LVK_IMPLOT_EXTERNAL`: Use external ImPlot library (default: OFF)
- `LVK_GLSLANG_EXTERNAL`: Use external glslang and SPIRV-Tools (default: OFF)
- `LVK_SPIRV_REFLECT_EXTERNAL`: Use external SPIRV-Reflect library (default: OFF)
- `LVK_ENABLE_LONG_PATHS_WIN32`: Enable long paths on Windows (default: ON)
- `LVK_ANDROID_ABI`: Enabled ABI on Android (cache string, default: `arm64-v8a`)
- `LVK_WITH_TENSORS`: Enable the machine learning helpers: the Arm VGF library and `lvk/HelpersVgf.h` (`lvk::VgfModel`, loads `.vgf` models into data graph pipelines) (default: ON)
- `LVK_WITH_ML_EMULATION_LAYER`: Download and build the Arm ML Emulation Layer for Vulkan as an ExternalProject to emulate `VK_ARM_tensors`/`VK_ARM_data_graph` on GPUs without native support (default: OFF). `DEMO_003_NeuralSuperSampling` enables the layer when the GPU lacks `VK_ARM_tensors`; `--no-ml-emulation` disables it. With `LVK_WITH_SAMPLES_ANDROID` the layer is also cross-built for every `LVK_ANDROID_ABI` (`MLEmulationLayerAndroid_<abi>`, needs `ninja` and the NDK's `llvm-strip`) into `build/ml-emulation-layer-android/jniLibs`, which the generated projects list in `jniLibs.srcDirs`, so the APKs carry it and the Android loader finds it by name

## Coding Style

### Formatting
- Enforced by `.clang-format`: 2-space indent, 140 column limit, no tabs, sorted includes, left-aligned pointers
- Apply via `clang-format -i <file>`
- CMake files: `.cmake-format` (2-space indent, canonical command case)

### Naming
- Types/structs: `PascalCase` (e.g., `Result`, `Viewport`)
- Enums: `EnumName_Value`
- Functions: `lowerCamelCase` (e.g., `getVertexFormatSize()`)
- Macros: `LVK_*`

### C++ Conventions
- Use C++20 designated initializers whenever possible (e.g., `lvk::RenderPass{.color = {...}}`)
- Use `if (ptr)` instead of `if (ptr != nullptr)` for pointer checks
- Use `if (value)` instead of `if (value != 0)` for integer checks
- Use `if (handle)` instead of `if (handle != VK_NULL_HANDLE)` or `if (handle != XR_NULL_HANDLE)` for Vulkan/OpenXR handle checks
- No STL containers in public API; the only exception is `std::vector` which is allowed in `.cpp` files and samples
- Use `()` after function names in code comments and commit messages (e.g., `// call doSomething() first`)
- Instead of deep nested if-blocks, prefer early exit
- **Use `const` on local variables whenever possible**
- **NEVER use `auto` except for lambda types** — always use explicit types
- **NEVER use `goto`**

## Commit Conventions
- Start with capital letter, no trailing period
- Use past tense (e.g., "Added", "Fixed", "Updated", "Replaced", "Removed")
- Optional scope prefix: `Samples:`, `Android:`, `CMake:`, `GitHub:`, `ImGui:`, `HelpersImGui:`, etc.
- Changes touching only `CMakeLists.txt` or `cmake/` files must use the `CMake:` prefix
- When a scope prefix is used, the first letter after `:` should be lowercase (e.g., `GitHub: added ...`)
- Use backticks around code identifiers: functions with `()`, types, extensions, macros
- Reference GitHub issues when applicable (e.g., `(#64)`, `(fixed #63)`)

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components
- **LVK Library** (`lvk/`): Main graphics API abstraction layer
  - `LVK.h/cpp`: Core API definitions and implementations
  - `vulkan/`: Vulkan-specific backend implementation
  - `HelpersImGui.h/cpp`: ImGui integration helpers
  - `HelpersVgf.h/cpp`: VGF model loading for `VK_ARM_data_graph` (`lvk::VgfModel`), compiled only with `LVK_WITH_TENSORS`

### Key Design Principles
1. **Bindless-only**: Utilizes Vulkan 1.3+ dynamic rendering, descriptor indexing, and buffer device address
2. **Minimal API surface**: No STL containers in public API
3. **Ray tracing integration**: Fully integrated with bindless design
4. **Cross-platform**: Windows, Linux, macOS (via KosmicKrisp), Android

### Sample Applications
Located in `samples/`, 19 demos covering:
- Basics: `001_HelloTriangle`, `002_RenderToCubeMap`, `003_RenderToCubeMapSinglePass`, `004_YUV`
- Advanced rendering: `005_MeshShaders`, `006_SwapchainHDR`, `007_DynamicRenderingLocalRead`, `008_MeshShaderFireworks`, `009_TriplanarMapping`, `010_OmniShadows`, `011_VariableRateShading`
- Ray tracing: `RTX_001_Hello`, `RTX_002_AO`, `RTX_003_Pipeline`, `RTX_004_Textures`
- Complex demos: `DEMO_001_SolarSystem`, `Tiny_MeshLarge`
- Multiview rendering examples: `010_OmniShadows`, `DEMO_001_SolarSystem`
- Neural graphics (`VK_ARM_tensors` + `VK_ARM_data_graph`, bindless tensors `kTensors<Type>_<Rank>[]` at set 0 binding 5): `DEMO_003_NeuralSuperSampling` runs Arm Neural Super Sampling (960x540 -> 1920x1080, `--4k` for 1920x1080 -> 3840x2160) on the Bistro scene (mesh and textures through `samples/Bistro.h`); its compute entry points are compiled into the sample and the algorithm comes from the `neural-graphics-sdk` dependency (a fork of the Arm Neural Graphics SDK that binds NSS resources bindlessly, pulled in at run time by a small `#include` resolver); the network comes from the `nss` entry of `bootstrap-content.json`
- Order-independent transparency: `DEMO_004_NeuralOIT` draws the whole Bistro transparent (mesh and textures through `samples/Bistro.h`) with three techniques: an A-buffer reference (the K nearest fragments per pixel, a lock-free sorted insertion of 64-bit depth+RGBA8 keys, evicted fragments tail-blended), weighted blended OIT (McGuire and Bavoil, JCGT 2013; one geometry pass, additive weighted accumulation plus a multiplicative revealage target, resolved in compute), and DFAOIT (Tsopouridis et al., CGF 2024), whose network is dispatched as a `VK_ARM_data_graph` pipeline loaded from a VGF with `lvk::VgfModel`. `--compare` reports the mean squared error against the A-buffer, `--diff` shows it, `--timings` prints GPU time per stage. The window is fixed to 1920x1080 because the graph needs a fixed shape; the network comes from `tools/train_dfaoit.py` + `tools/make_dfaoit_model.py`. It keeps the k nearest fragments of a pixel exactly (the paper's DFAOIT_k, k = 4, read back out of the network as `inputs - 10`) and predicts only the tail behind them, which is what beats the authors' own weights on Bistro by an order of magnitude. A pixel with no more than k fragments has no tail to ask for, so the pack pass leaves it out of the input tensor and compacts the rest into `kTensorHeight` rows (a workgroup-aggregated counter hands out the rows, the resolve pass reads each pixel's row back out of `slotsBuffer`, and a pixel that does not fit falls back to compositing the mean of its tail analytically)

### Android Project Generation
Android sample projects are generated by CMake (`ADD_DEMO()` macro in `samples/CMakeLists.txt`) into `build/android/<app>/`. The system uses two layers:
- **`android/lvklib/`**: Shared Android library module containing `LvkActivity` base class (fullscreen/immersive mode, storage permissions), styles, and data extraction rules. Not copied — referenced in-place from generated projects via a relative path in `settings.gradle`.
- **`android/app/`**: Minimal per-app templates (`.in` files) that only substitute `@APP_NAME@` and `@ANDROID_ABI_FILTERS@`. `MainActivity.java.in` just extends `LvkActivity` and loads the native library.

When modifying shared Android behavior (permissions, fullscreen logic, themes), edit `android/lvklib/`. When modifying per-app scaffolding (package name, native library wiring), edit the `.in` templates in `android/app/`.

### Common Development Patterns
- All samples use `VulkanApp` base class (`samples/VulkanApp.h`)
- Samples that render Bistro/Sponza share `samples/Bistro.h`: the mesh cache (`loadAndCache()`, `loadFromCache()`, `vertexData_`, `indexData_`, `cachedMaterials_`) and the asynchronous BC7 material texture loader (`loadMaterialTextures()`, `processLoadedMaterialTextures()`, `cancelLoadingMaterialTextures()`, `materials_`). `Tiny_MeshLarge` still carries its own copy
- Platform abstraction through preprocessor macros
- Resource management via LVK handles and holders
- Tracy profiler integration when enabled

### Dependencies
- Vulkan 1.3+ (required)
- GLFW (desktop platforms)
- SDL3 (desktop platforms, alternative to GLFW via `LVK_WITH_SDL3`)
- GLM (math library)
- ImGui (UI)
- Tracy (optional profiling)
- Various third-party libraries managed via the `third-party/bootstrap.py` script and listed in `third-party/bootstrap-deps.json`
- Content files managed via the `third-party/bootstrap.py` script and listed in `third-party/bootstrap-content.json`

### Vulkan Interop
`lvk/vulkan/VulkanUtils.h` provides helpers (`getVkDevice()`, `getVkCommandBuffer()`, `getVkImage()`, ...) to access
the underlying Vulkan objects, enabling mixing of LVK and raw Vulkan API calls. Building with `LVK_WITH_RAW_VULKAN=ON` additionally
pulls the Vulkan headers into `lvk/LVK.h` and exposes conversion operators such as `ICommandBuffer::operator VkCommandBuffer()`.
