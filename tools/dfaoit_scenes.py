"""Synthetic scenes of transparent primitives, sampled as tiles of depth-ordered fragment lists.

`tools/train_dfaoit.py` used to sample a pixel's fragment list numerically, one pixel at a time and independent of
every other. That is enough for a network that looks at one pixel, and it is what the shipped 1x1 network was trained
on, but it cannot train anything that reads its neighbours: neighbouring pixels carry no information about each other
by construction, so a convolution would learn to ignore them.

So here the fragments come from geometry instead. A scene is a handful of spheres, boxes, quads and tori with random
placement, colour and opacity; a tile of orthographic rays is fired through it and every entry and exit of every
primitive becomes a fragment. Neighbouring rays then hit the same surfaces at slightly different depths, which is
exactly the coherence a spatial network has to learn from, and silhouettes, nesting and back-face pairs all come out
on their own rather than being modelled by hand.

Rays are orthographic along +z: the network never sees camera parameters, and every intersection stays closed form.
The ray parameter t is the depth, since the direction is a unit vector and the origin sits at z = 0.

    tiles, counts = sampleTiles(numTiles, numPrimitives, tileSize, rng)

`tiles.color` is (numTiles, tileSize * tileSize, maxFragments, 3) and `tiles.alpha` the matching opacity, both sorted
by depth with the misses pushed to the end; `counts` is how many of those entries are real.
